## Clinical Trial Outcomes Simulation Under Patient Dropout Using R Shiny
* Develop an interactive R Shiny webapp to simulate clinical trial outcomes under varying patient dropout scenarios
* Apply statistical methods to estimate treatment effects, adherence rates, and confidence intervals
* Produce a written analysis summarizing background, simulation design, app usage, key findings, and limitations
